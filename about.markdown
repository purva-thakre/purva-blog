I am a PhD student in applied physics at Southern Illinois University in
Carbondale, IL. You can contact me at <purva dot thakre at siu dot edu>.

I mostly blog about various topics related to my research - quantum information,
quantum computing, group theory, quantum open source projects.

This blog's public repository is available here : <https://github.com/purva-thakre/purva-blog>. Discussions related to errors, typos and/or suggestions are welcome.
